# CART POLE BALANCING

## AIM
To develop and fine tune the Monte Carlo algorithm to stabilize the Cart Pole.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem statement involves using a MC control algorithm on the discretized Cart pole environment. The environment consists of a Pole balancing on a cart, we know about the cart length, velocity, pole angle and pole angular velocity and aim to keep the pole upright by moving it either to the right or the left direction and keep it within specified bounds.

## MONTE CARLO CONTROL ALGORITHM FOR CART POLE BALANCING


## MONTE CARLO CONTROL FUNCTION
Include the Monte Carlo control function

## OUTPUT:
1. Specify the average number of steps achieved within two minutes when the Monte Carlo (MC) control algorithm is initiated with zero-initialized Q-values..
2. Mention the average number of steps maintained over a four-minute period when the Monte Carlo (MC) control algorithm is executed with pretrained Q-values.
